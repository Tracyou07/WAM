"""Verify ``_export_runtime_backbone`` remap for dual-expert packed coupling.

After ``DualExpertPolicyVariant.attach_visual_tower`` transfers ownership of
``visual_tower.core.blocks`` and ``action_expert.blocks`` into a
``DualExpertPackedBlockStack``, the bare ``visual_tower.core.state_dict()`` no longer
contains any ``blocks.*`` entries. The exporter therefore needs to re-key
``packed_blocks.{i}.video_block.*`` back into ``blocks.{i}.*`` so the saved
``transformer/`` directory is a drop-in replacement for the pre-surgery
layout consumed by LingBot loaders and parallel-stream visualization scripts.
